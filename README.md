## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (7-1 architecture)
- Flexbox
- Vite for development and bundling
- Responsive design with rem units

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned several new concepts and improved my skills in the following areas:

- **SCSS architecture:** I used the 7-1 SCSS architecture to keep the code modular and maintainable. This helped organize the styles better and avoid duplication.
- **Responsive Design:** By using rem units and Flexbox, I achieved a layout that adjusts well across different screen sizes.
- **List Styling:** I customized bullet points and list style positions effectively while handling alignment and padding issues with `<div>` and `<span>` tags.
